Install Libraries:
First, you need to install some libraries.
Open your command prompt or terminal and type
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will set up everything you need.

Open Model Files:
For the first model, open the file seq2seq_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
For the second model, open seq2seq_LSTM_Attention.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Check Your Files:
Make sure the file eng_french.csv and the folder glove.6B (note: model is configured for 200d glove embeddings) are in the same place as your .ipynb files.
This is important for the models to work right.
